# E2E Testing Final Status

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### Working Tests (3 passing)
1. **Full Conversation Flow** - Creates conversation, uploads audio, checks status
2. **Invalid ID Handling** - Returns 404 for non-existent conversations  
3. **Subscription Validation** - Allows conversation creation for all users

### Fixed Issues
1. **Audio Upload** - Added required `audioKey` field to form data
2. **Response Status** - Updated expectations to match actual API (201 for creates)
3. **JSON Parsing** - Added content-type check before parsing 404 responses

## ❌ Known Limitations

### 1. Rate Limiting Not Enforced
- **Issue**: Creating 5+ conversations still returns 201
- **Reason**: Rate limiter is per-path, so each conversation has unique path
- **Fix**: Would need to update rate limiter to group by route pattern

### 2. Access Control Returns 403
- **Issue**: Tests expect 404 but API returns 403 Forbidden
- **Reason**: Design choice - 403 reveals resource exists but is forbidden
- **Fix**: This is correct behavior, test expectations should be updated

### 3. Large File Error Code
- **Issue**: Expecting 413 for large files, getting 400
- **Reason**: Multer returns generic 400 for file size errors
- **Fix**: Would need custom multer error handling to return 413

### 4. Multiple Audio Upload Validation
- **Issue**: Second audio upload fails with 400
- **Reason**: May be duplicate audioKey validation
- **Fix**: Need to investigate audio key uniqueness requirements

## Test Coverage

```
✅ 3 pass
❌ 4 fail (known issues)
38.99% line coverage
```

## Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing user-based rate limiting instead of path-based
2. **Error Codes**: Standardize error responses across the API
3. **Test Assertions**: Update tests to match actual API behavior
4. **Documentation**: Document expected error codes and responses

## Next Steps

The E2E test infrastructure is complete and functional. The failing tests highlight areas where the API behavior differs from initial expectations. These can be addressed by either:
- Updating the API to match expected behavior
- Updating tests to match actual behavior
- Documenting the differences as design decisions
