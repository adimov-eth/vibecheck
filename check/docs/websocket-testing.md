# WebSocket Testing Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the WebSocket test suite implementation for the VibeCheck backend.

## Test Structure

### Test Categories

1. **Connection Management**
   - Establishing WebSocket connections
   - Handling multiple connections from the same user
   - Connection cleanup on disconnect
   - Connection limit enforcement

2. **Authentication**
   - Valid token authentication
   - Invalid token rejection
   - Authentication timeout (10 seconds)
   - Expired session handling

3. **Message Handling**
   - Topic subscription/unsubscription
   - Ping/pong messages
   - Authentication requirement enforcement
   - Malformed message handling

4. **Broadcasting**
   - Broadcasting to subscribed clients
   - Selective broadcasting based on topic subscriptions

5. **Error Handling**
   - WebSocket error resilience
   - Redis error handling
   - Server stability after errors

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mock Strategy
- Used Bun's built-in mocking system
- Created standalone mock objects for Redis client
- Mocked session verification for controlled test scenarios

### 2. Test Isolation
- Each test creates its own HTTP server on a random port
- Full cleanup after each test (connections, server, WebSocket state)
- Database cleanup between tests

### 3. Async/Await Pattern
- All WebSocket operations use Promise-based patterns
- Event listeners are wrapped in promises for clean async flow
- Proper timeout handling for long-running operations

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run WebSocket tests only
bun test src/utils/websocket/__tests__/websocket.test.ts

# Run with increased timeout for auth timeout test
bun test src/utils/websocket/__tests__/websocket.test.ts --timeout 20000
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Basic connection establishment
- ✅ Authentication flow (success and failure)
- ✅ Message routing and handling
- ✅ Topic subscription management
- ✅ Broadcasting to multiple clients
- ✅ Error recovery and server stability
- ✅ Connection limits and cleanup

## Known Limitations

1. **Redis Pub/Sub**: Direct Redis pub/sub testing is limited to mocked interactions
2. **Memory Pressure**: Memory pressure handling tests require more complex setup
3. **Buffered Messages**: Full buffered message testing requires Redis integration

## Future Improvements

1. Add performance benchmarks for concurrent connections
2. Implement stress testing with thousands of connections
3. Add integration tests with real Redis instance
4. Test WebSocket reconnection strategies
5. Add metrics collection during tests
