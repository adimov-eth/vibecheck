# E2E Testing Status

## Current Progress

### ✅ Working
1. **Test Server**: Express server starts on random port
2. **Database**: Test database initialization and cleanup
3. **Authentication**: JWT token creation and validation
4. **Conversation Creation**: POST /conversations endpoint works (201 status)

### ❌ Issues to Fix

1. **Audio Upload (400 error)**
   - Endpoint expects conversationId in request body
   - Currently sending in FormData
   - Need to check if multer is parsing form fields correctly

2. **Rate Limiting Not Enforced**
   - Creating 5+ conversations still returns 201
   - Need to verify rate limiter configuration
   - May need to wait between requests or use same IP

3. **Access Control (403 vs 404)**
   - API returns 403 Forbidden for other users' conversations
   - Tests expect 404 Not Found
   - This is a design decision - 403 reveals resource exists

4. **File Size Validation**
   - Expecting 413 for large files, getting 400
   - Need to check multer error handling

### Test Results Summary
```
✅ 2 pass (basic tests work)
❌ 5 fail (specific behaviors need adjustment)
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix audio upload by ensuring conversationId is properly sent
2. Investigate rate limiting configuration
3. Adjust test expectations for access control
4. Fix file size error handling
5. Complete remaining E2E test files (auth, audio processing, subscription)
