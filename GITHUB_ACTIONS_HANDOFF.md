# GitHub Actions & Deployment Handoff Document

## üìÖ Session Summary (Date: 2025-01-26)

### üéØ What Was Accomplished

1. **Fixed CI Workflow Reusability**
   - Added `workflow_call` trigger to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - This resolved the error where deploy-production.yml couldn't call ci.yml
   - Commit: `11259f6` - "fix: make CI workflow reusable by adding workflow_call trigger"

2. **Fixed Frontend Test Hanging Issue**
   - Changed `vibe/package.json` test script from `jest --watchAll` to `jest --passWithNoTests`
   - Added separate `test:watch` script for local development
   - This prevents tests from hanging indefinitely in CI
   - Commit: `8a188cf` - "fix: update test script to exit properly in CI"

3. **Created Monitoring Tools**
   - Created `scripts/monitor-github-actions.sh` for comprehensive workflow monitoring
   - Provides quick status checks, failure reports, and health checks

### üìä Current Status

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- ‚úÖ CI workflow is now reusable
- ‚úÖ Frontend CI tests now complete properly
- ‚ùå Backend CI failing (missing OPENAI_API_KEY in GitHub Secrets)
- ‚ùå Security scan failing (vulnerabilities detected)
- ‚ùå Deployment blocked due to test failures

**Server Status:**
- Server IP: `165.232.180.34`
- Domain: `v.bkk.lol`
- Health check returning 502 (app not deployed yet)
- PM2 services were accidentally deleted but instructions provided for restoration

### üö® Critical Issues

1. **Missing GitHub Secrets**
   - The deployment workflow requires secrets that aren't configured
   - Backend CI fails because OPENAI_API_KEY is not set
   - Deployment can't proceed without these secrets

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Trivy security scan is detecting issues
   - Need to investigate and resolve or adjust severity levels

3. **Production App Not Running**
   - Due to CI/CD failures, deployment hasn't succeeded
   - Server returns 502 error on health checks

## üìã TODO List for Next Agent

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets (CRITICAL)
Go to: https://github.com/adimov-eth/vibecheck/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = [Get from OpenAI dashboard]
DEPLOY_HOST = v.bkk.lol
DEPLOY_USER = sammy
DEPLOY_PATH = /home/sammy
DEPLOY_KEY = [SSH private key - see below]
```

To get the deploy key:
```bash
# If exists locally:
cat ~/.ssh/vibecheck-deploy/deploy_key

# Or generate new one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy_key -N "" -C "github-actions-deploy"
# Add deploy_key.pub to server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Add deploy_key content to GitHub secrets
```

### 2. Fix Security Scan Issues
```bash
# Check what vulnerabilities are being flagged
cd /Users/adimov/Developer/final
gh run view [latest-run-id] --log | grep -A 20 "Security Scan"

# Options:
# a) Fix critical vulnerabilities
# b) Update .github/workflows/ci.yml to only fail on CRITICAL (not HIGH)
# c) Add .trivyignore file for false positives
```

### 3. Verify and Deploy
Once secrets are added:
```bash
# Trigger a new deployment
git checkout main
git pull
echo "<!-- Deployment trigger $(date) -->" >> README.md
git add . && git commit -m "chore: trigger deployment after adding secrets"
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/monitor-github-actions.sh

# Once deployed, verify on server
ssh sammy@165.232.180.34 'pm2 list && curl -I http://localhost:3001/health'
```

### 4. Restore PM2 Services on Server
If trans-bot services still need restoration:
```bash
# SSH to server and restore trans-bot
ssh sammy@165.232.180.34
cd ~/trans-bot
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

### 5. Optional Improvements

**a) Add typecheck script to backend:**
```json
// In check/package.json scripts:
"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
```

**b) Add build script to avoid CI warnings:**
```json
// In check/package.json scripts:
"build": "echo 'No build required for Bun runtime'"
```

**c) Consider adding actual tests:**
- Create `check/src/__tests__/` directory
- Add basic API tests
- Update CI to run actual tests

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Update `GITHUB_ACTIONS_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` with lessons learned
- Document the GitHub secrets in a secure location
- Update deployment documentation with current server details

## üîß Useful Commands

**Check workflow status:**
```bash
gh run list --limit 5
gh workflow view "Deploy to Production"
./scripts/monitor-github-actions.sh
```

**Debug failed runs:**
```bash
gh run view [run-id] --log-failed
gh run view [run-id] --web
```

**Re-run workflows:**
```bash
gh run rerun [run-id] --failed
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml
```

**Server commands:**
```bash
# Check PM2 status
ssh sammy@165.232.180.34 'pm2 list'

# View logs
ssh sammy@165.232.180.34 'pm2 logs --lines 50'

# Check app health
curl -I https://v.bkk.lol/health
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Port Configuration**: Backend runs on port 3001 (not 3000)
2. **PM2 Config**: Uses `ecosystem.config.js` (not .cjs)
3. **Working Directory**: Backend deploys to `/home/sammy/check/`
4. **Node/Bun**: Backend uses Bun runtime, frontend uses Node/pnpm

## üéØ Success Criteria

The deployment pipeline is working when:
1. ‚úÖ All CI checks pass (Backend, Frontend, Security)
2. ‚úÖ Deployment to production completes successfully
3. ‚úÖ Health check returns 200: `curl -I https://v.bkk.lol/health`
4. ‚úÖ PM2 shows all services running: `pm2 list`
5. ‚úÖ No errors in logs: `pm2 logs --err --lines 50`

**Priority**: Add GitHub Secrets first - nothing will work without them!
