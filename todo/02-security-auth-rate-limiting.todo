## Configuration
```typescript
// check/src/config/rate-limits.ts
export const rateLimitConfig = {
  auth: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    maxAttempts: {
      perIP: 5,
      perEmail: 10,
      beforeCaptcha: 3,
      beforeLockout: 10
    },
    progressiveDelays: [0, 1000, 5000, 15000, 30000, 60000],
    blockDuration: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    captchaTTL: 5 * 60, // 5 minutes
  }
};
```

## Rollback Plan
- Feature flag for rate limiting
- Ability to disable via environment variable
- Quick Redis flush for stuck limits
- Fallback to in-memory limiting if Redis fails

## Security Considerations
- Ensure rate limiting doesn't leak user existence
- Protect against distributed attacks (multiple IPs)
- Consider implementing proof-of-work as alternative to CAPTCHA
- Monitor for bypass attempts
- Regular security audits of limits

## Implementation Plan Outline

This section details the files to be created or updated, and the core implementation points for each, to fulfill the requirements of the "Implement Authentication Rate Limiting" feature.

### Files to Create

1.  **`check/src/config/rate-limits.ts`**
    *   **Purpose:** Centralized configuration for all rate limiting parameters.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Define and export the `rateLimitConfig` object as specified in the "Configuration" section of this document.
        *   Ensure all values (windowMs, maxAttempts, progressiveDelays, blockDuration, captchaTTL) are clearly defined and accessible.

2.  **`check/src/services/rate-limiter-service.ts`** (Corresponds to Task 2)
    *   **Purpose:** Encapsulate the logic for various rate limiting strategies.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Create an `AuthRateLimiter` class or a set of factory functions.
        *   Utilize `rate-limiter-flexible` with a Redis store (`ioredis` or similar, ensure Redis connection is managed).
        *   Implement `IPBasedLimiter`:
            *   Consumes points per IP address.
            *   Uses `rateLimitConfig.auth.maxAttempts.perIP` and `rateLimitConfig.auth.windowMs`.
        *   Implement `UserBasedLimiter` (for email/username):
            *   Consumes points per user identifier.
            *   Uses `rateLimitConfig.auth.maxAttempts.perEmail` and a relevant window (e.g., 1 hour).
        *   Implement `LoginAttemptTracker` for progressive delays:
            *   Tracks consecutive failed attempts for a user/IP.
            *   Applies increasing delays based on `rateLimitConfig.auth.progressiveDelays`.
            *   Manages block duration (`rateLimitConfig.auth.blockDuration`) after exceeding max attempts in the progressive sequence.

3.  **`check/src/middleware/auth-rate-limit.ts`** (Corresponds to Task 3)
    *   **Purpose:** Provide Express middleware for easy application to routes.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Export an `authRateLimitMiddleware` object.
        *   `byIP(req, res, next)`: Middleware function using `IPBasedLimiter` from `rate-limiter-service.ts`.
        *   `byEmail(emailExtractor: (req) => string | undefined)`: A flexible middleware function that takes an email extractor. It will use `UserBasedLimiter`. The `emailExtractor` function will be responsible for getting the email from `req.body`, `req.query`, or `req.params` as appropriate for the route.
        *   `progressive(identifierExtractor: (req) => string | undefined)`: Middleware applying progressive delays using `LoginAttemptTracker`. The `identifierExtractor` would typically get IP or a combination if needed.
        *   `captcha(req, res, next)`: Middleware to check if CAPTCHA is required (e.g., after `rateLimitConfig.auth.maxAttempts.beforeCaptcha` failures). If required and not yet solved/passed, it should block the request or redirect to a CAPTCHA challenge.

4.  **`check/src/models/failed-login-attempt.ts`** (or `check/src/services/failed-login-service.ts`) (Corresponds to Task 4)
    *   **Purpose:** Track and manage records of failed login attempts.
    *   **Implementation (using Redis):**
        *   `recordFailedAttempt(details: { ip: string; email?: string; reason: string; timestamp: number })`: Stores attempt data in Redis, possibly using a list for each IP/email with TTL.
        *   `getFailedAttempts(identifier: string, windowSeconds: number): Promise<Attempt[]>`: Retrieves attempts for an IP or email within a given time window.
        *   `resetFailedAttempts(identifier: string)`: Clears tracked attempts for an identifier.
        *   `isBlocked(identifier: string): Promise<boolean>`: Checks if an identifier (IP/email) is currently under a block (e.g., due to max progressive delay attempts).
        *   `incrementFailureCount(identifier: string, type: 'ip' | 'email' | 'captcha')`: Increments failure counts for different contexts, stored in Redis with appropriate TTLs. Used to trigger CAPTCHA or lockout.
        *   `getFailureCount(identifier: string, type: 'ip' | 'email' | 'captcha')`: Retrieves current failure count.

5.  **`check/src/services/captcha-service.ts`** (Corresponds to Task 6)
    *   **Purpose:** Manage CAPTCHA generation, validation, and related logic.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   `generateCaptchaChallenge(): Promise<{ challengeId: string; captchaData: any }>`: Generates a CAPTCHA (e.g., text, simple math), stores solution in Redis with `challengeId` and TTL (`rateLimitConfig.auth.captchaTTL`). Returns data needed for client to render CAPTCHA.
        *   `validateCaptchaResponse(challengeId: string, userResponse: string): Promise<boolean>`: Validates user's response against the stored solution in Redis. Deletes challenge from Redis after attempt.
        *   (Optional) `trackCaptchaSolveRates()`: Log attempts for monitoring.
    *   **Associated Routes (likely in `check/src/api/routes/auth.ts` or a new `captcha.ts`):**
        *   `GET /auth/captcha`: Calls `generateCaptchaChallenge`.
        *   `POST /auth/captcha/verify`: Expects `challengeId` and `userResponse`, calls `validateCaptchaResponse`.

6.  **`check/src/services/account-lockout-service.ts`** (Corresponds to Task 7)
    *   **Purpose:** Handle account lockout and unlock procedures.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   `checkAndLockAccount(email: string): Promise<boolean>`: Checks failure count (e.g., from `failed-login-service.ts` using `rateLimitConfig.auth.maxAttempts.beforeLockout`). If threshold met, locks account (sets a flag in user DB), sends security email. Returns true if locked.
        *   `isAccountLocked(email: string): Promise<boolean>`: Checks lock status from user DB.
        *   `initiateUnlockProcess(email: string)`: Generates an unlock token, stores it (Redis or DB) with TTL, sends email with unlock link/token.
        *   `verifyAndUnlockAccount(token: string): Promise<boolean>`: Verifies token, unlocks account in DB.
        *   Admin override function for unlocking accounts.
    *   **Associated Routes (likely in `check/src/api/routes/user.ts` or `auth.ts`):**
        *   Endpoint to request unlock email.
        *   Endpoint to submit unlock token/verify via link.

7.  **`check/src/middleware/__tests__/auth-rate-limit.test.ts`** (Corresponds to Task 9)
    *   **Purpose:** Test the rate limiting middleware.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest) with `supertest` for HTTP requests.
        *   Mock Redis (e.g., `ioredis-mock`) and other external dependencies.
        *   Test cases:
            *   IP-based limiting: successful requests, exceeding limit, block, reset.
            *   Email-based limiting: similar flow.
            *   Progressive delays: verify increasing delays, eventual block.
            *   CAPTCHA requirement: trigger CAPTCHA, successful bypass, failed bypass.
            *   Correct headers (`X-RateLimit-*`, `Retry-After`).
            *   (Advanced) Test distributed limiting if applicable (mocking multiple instances or specific Redis interactions).

8.  **`check/docs/rate-limiting.md`** (Corresponds to Task 10)
    *   **Purpose:** Document the rate limiting system.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Detail all configured limits and thresholds (from `rateLimitConfig`).
        *   Explain the progressive delay algorithm and block conditions.
        *   Troubleshooting guide for common issues (e.g., legitimate users being blocked, Redis issues).
        *   List relevant monitoring queries/metrics to observe.
        *   Explain expected rate limit headers in API responses.

### Files to Update

1.  **`check/package.json`** (Corresponds to Task 1)
    *   **Action:** Add dependencies.
    *   **Details:**
        ```json
        "dependencies": {
          // ... other dependencies
          "rate-limiter-flexible": "^3.0.0", // Or latest stable
          "express-rate-limit": "^7.1.0",    // For simpler IP/general limiting if preferred for some cases
          "express-slow-down": "^2.0.0"      // For progressive delays if not custom implemented
        }
        ```
    *   **Post-Action:** Run `bun install`.

2.  **`check/src/api/routes/user.ts`** (and other auth-related route files) (Corresponds to Task 5)
    *   **Action:** Integrate rate limiting middleware and account lockout checks.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Apply `authRateLimitMiddleware.byIP` to all sensitive auth endpoints.
        *   Apply `authRateLimitMiddleware.progressive` where progressive delays are desired (e.g., login attempts).
        *   For endpoints involving user identity (login, password reset initiation):
            *   First, check `isAccountLocked(email)` from `account-lockout-service.ts`.
            *   Then, apply `authRateLimitMiddleware.byEmail(req => req.body.email)`.
            *   After failed attempts that pass initial rate limits, call `recordFailedAttempt` and then `checkAndLockAccount`.
        *   Integrate `authRateLimitMiddleware.captcha` to be checked before processing login if failure counts dictate.
        *   Ensure all auth responses include standard rate limit headers:
            *   `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.
            *   `Retry-After` when a request is blocked. This can be set by `rate-limiter-flexible` automatically or manually in middleware.

3.  **API Documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI specification, existing markdown docs)** (Corresponds to Task 10)
    *   **Action:** Update with rate limiting information.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Document the rate limit response headers for all relevant endpoints.
        *   Describe error responses related to rate limiting (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and what they mean.
        *   Mention CAPTCHA flow if applicable.

### Monitoring and Alerts (Corresponds to Task 8)

*   **Action:** Configure monitoring and alerting.
*   **Details:** This is typically done in an external system (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.) or via custom logging and alerting scripts.
    *   **Metrics to Track:**
        *   Rate of failed login attempts (per IP, per email).
        *   Number of currently blocked IPs/users.
        *   CAPTCHA challenges issued vs. solved/failed.
        *   Number of accounts locked per hour/day.
        *   Latency impact of rate limiting middleware.
        *   Redis performance (latency, memory usage related to rate limiting keys).
    *   **Alerts to Configure:**
        *   Sudden spike in failed login attempts (overall, or from specific IPs).
        *   High rate of CAPTCHA failures.
        *   Significant number of account lockouts.
        *   Redis connectivity issues or high latency affecting rate limiting.
    *   **Admin Dashboard Endpoint (Optional - New Route):**
        *   `GET /admin/rate-limit-stats`: An endpoint secured for admins to view current stats (blocked IPs, recent high-volume attempts, etc.).

### Rollback Plan Considerations

*   Ensure a feature flag (e.g., environment variable `ENABLE_AUTH_RATE_LIMITING`) is checked by the middleware to easily disable the entire system.
*   If Redis fails, the rate limiters from `rate-limiter-flexible` can be configured with an `inMemoryBlockOnConsumed` option or similar as a fallback, though this wouldn't be distributed. A simpler approach is to bypass rate limiting if Redis is down, log an error, and alert.

This detailed plan should guide the implementation of robust authentication rate limiting.
